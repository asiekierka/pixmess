Network protocol for pixmess
by Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russell, 2012

Draft #03

Layers:
	See doc/layer.txt for format details.

Types:
	Note, all types are *little-endian*.
	
	Fields marked with * indicate that this does not show up
	in the client->server version.
	
	pstr8 = pascal string w/ 8-bit length (u8 len, u8 chars[len])
	pstr16 = pascal string w/ 16-bit length (u16 len, u8 chars[len])
	s8 = signed 8-bit int
	s16 = signed 16-bit int
	s32 = signed 32-bit int
	u8 = unsigned 8-bit int
	u16 = unsigned 16-bit int
	u32 = unsigned 32-bit int
	w8 = wraparound 8-bit int
	w16 = wraparound 16-bit int
	w32 = wraparound 32-bit int

Packets:

$00 = *RESERVED*

$01 = block_set(w16 x, w16 y, s8 typ, s8 col, s8 ch) *->*
$02 = block_push(w16 x, w16 y, s8 typ, s8 col, s8 ch) *->*
	Sets or pushes a block onto a layer.
	The difference is that "pushing" makes a copy of the current tile,
	and then sticks that underneath the new tile.
	
$03 = block_pop(w16 x, w16 y) *->*
	Pops a block off the top of a layer.
	
	If there is no under type, set the tile to a col=0x07 ch=0x20 dummy.

$10 = entity_movement(u16 id, s8 dx, s8 dy) S->C
$10 = entity_movement(u8 dir) C->S
	Indicates a player's movement in direction (dx,dy).
	
	Note, in the client->server version,
	dir is in this format:
	  %yyyyxxxx
	where x and y are signed nybbles indicating direction,
	and -8 does not mean anything yet - IT IS RESERVED.

$11 = entity_creation(u16 id, s32 x, s32 y, s16 col, s16 ch, pstr8 name) S->C
	Indicates the creation of a new entity.

$40 = layer_request(s32 x, s32 y, u8 index) C->S
	Requests a layer chunk from the server.

$41 = layer_start(s32 x, s32 y, u8 index, u32 rawlen, u32 cmplen) S->C
$42 = layer_data(pstr16 data) S->C
$43 = layer_end() S->C
	Sends a GZipped layer chunk in pieces.
	These three must appear in the correct fashion of $41 ($42)+ $43.
	
	The "csize" field indicates the compressed size.
	The "usize" field indicates the uncompressed size.
	
	Once the layer has been sent, the appropriate $11 "entity_creation"
	messages need to be sent to the client.

$44 = layer_release(s32 x, s32 y, u8 index) *->*
	Indicates that the layer chunk is no longer being handled.
	C->S: Tells the server to stop sending info about this chunk.
	S->C: Tells the client it's stopped sending info about this chunk.
	
	Note, a C->S release does NOT require a S->C release to be sent back.
	This is a mechanism to deal with crap clients, tight server limits,
	OR theoretical algorithmic wraparound issues.
	
	Once this has been sent/received, the appropriate
	$51 "entity_destruction" messages need to be sent to the client.
	
	NOTE: This does NOT forward the entity_destruction message to other
	      players, ESPECIALLY if the client is releasing the layer chunk
	      it is in! DOING THIS IS A SECURITY HOLE WHICH OPENS THIS GAME UP
	      FOR INVISIBILITY HACKS!!!

$50 = entity_position(u16 id*, s32 x, s32 y) *->*
	Resynchronises an entity's position.
	(I still don't know why we have to do this!
	 It had to be done in BuildAFort, too. --GM)
	
	C->S: Informs the server of the client's current position.
	S->C: Sets the position of the entity (can be used for teleports!).

$51 = entity_destruction(u16 id) *->*
	Indicates that the given entity is no longer to be tracked.
	
	C->S: Tells the server to stop mentioning this entity.
	S->C: Tells the client to remove this entity.
	
	IMPORTANT: This is NOT a "disconnect" method! (See $7F "kick".)
	
	There may be provisions for a "spectator" or "lobby" mode,
	but for now the client / server should IGNORE requests for
	removal of the relevant client player ID.

$58 = chat(pstr8 message) *->*
	C->S: Send a chat message / command.
	S->C: Adds the given string to the client's chatbox.

$7B = login(u16 version, u16 chr, u16 col, pstr8 name) C->S
	Attempt to get into the server.
	
	Server should respond with one of the following:
	
	Failure:
	- $7F kick(some_reason)
	
	Success:
	- $7E player_id(your_id)
	- $11 entity_creation(your_id, your_x, your_y,
			your_col, your_ch, your_name)
		- sent to you
		- broadcast to those who are subscribed to your layer chunk
	- $58 chat("* %s has joined" % (your_name))
		- broadcast to all
	
	NOTE: Creation of other entities only happens on chunk loads!

$7C = ping(w8 pktid) *->*
$7D = pong(w8 pktid) *->*
	If you receive a ping, you send back a pong IMMEDIATELY.
	
	pktid follows a rolling counter.

$7E = player_id(u16 id*) *->*
	C->S: Request current player ID.
	S->C: Sends a client's player ID to them.

$7F = kick(pstr8 reason) *->*
	S->C: The client is kicked.
	C->S: The client has indicated that it has quit.
	
	Either way, the connection MUST be severed.

Stuff to expand upon:
- The reason why I said call them finite "layers" was so that you could
  actually have movable layers, e.g. TRAINS. However, I guess you could treat
  it in such a way that there's a "root layerset".
  
  With this said, the protocol would need to be adjusted for the creation and
  removal of such layers, and the ability to select which layer is to be
  modified and whatnot.
